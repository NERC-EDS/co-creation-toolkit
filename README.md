# How to contribute to this toolkit

We encourage community contributions! You can share your own resources, case studies, or suggest improvements via our GitHub repository. You can also get in touch with us at ux@bgs.ac.uk

## Add new Case Studies

> Case studies showcase real-world examples of how UX (User Experience) methods have been successfully applied to address environmental data challenges. Your contributions should include a brief overview of the project, the specific UX methods used (e.g., design sprints, user research, prototyping), the outcomes achieved, and any key takeaways for others working on similar projects. Your case studies will inspire and guide others in the field, demonstrating the power of user-centered design.

## Add new tools to the UX Toolkit

> Toolkit includes templates, guides, and documents that can help others implement effective UX practices in their environmental data projects.

Your contributions will empower others to gather user insights, design user-friendly solutions, and create impactful environmental data products and services.
