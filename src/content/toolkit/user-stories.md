## Overview

 User stories are a powerful tool for building digital products that meet the needs of your users. This post will guide you through the **key steps in creating user stories**, from understanding their structure to prioritising and testing them.

### What are User Stories?

User stories are simple, clear descriptions of a feature or functionality told from the perspective of the user. They help everyone on the team understand and agree on what needs to be built and why.

### Components of a User Story

A user story has **two** main components:

#### 1. The User Story itself:
This follows a simple structure: **"As a [user], I want to [do something] so that [I can achieve some goal]."**

**Example:**\
"As an environmental researcher, I want to download climate data in CSV format so that I can analyse it in my preferred statistical software."

#### 2. Acceptance Criteria:
These define how you know the user story has been successfully delivered. They are specific and testable statements that provide a clear definition of "done."
    
**Example:**\
"When I click the 'Download' button, the data should be downloaded as a CSV file with the date and time included in the file name."

### Grouping User Stories into Epics

> An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller **user stories**. Epics usually represent a significant feature or objective, often encompassing multiple user stories.

### Steps for Creating User Stories

#### Step 1: Understand Your Users

- **Conduct user research:** Use methods like interviews, surveys, and observation to understand your target audience's needs, goals, and pain points.
- **Create user personas:** Develop fictional representations of your ideal users based on your research. This helps you keep the user in mind throughout the process.

#### Step 2: Define Epics

- **Identify key features:** Determine the major functionalities your product needs to offer to meet user needs.
- **Create epics:** Formulate these key features as epics, which are large, overarching goals. For example, "Enable users to easily access and download environmental data."

#### Step 3:  Craft User Stories

- **Break down epics:** Divide each epic into smaller, more manageable user stories.
- **Use the user story format:** "As a [user], I want to [do something] so that [I can achieve some goal]."
- **Example:** "As an environmental consultant, I want to filter air quality data by location so that I can assess pollution levels in a specific area."

#### Step 4:  Define Acceptance Criteria

- **Specify desired outcomes:** For each user story, define clear and testable acceptance criteria.
- **Use the acceptance criteria format:** "When happens, [y] should happen."
- **Example:** "When I select a location on the map, the data table should only display air quality readings from that area."

#### Step 5:  Collaborate with Design

- **Visualise the user experience:** Work with designers to create mockups or prototypes that illustrate how the feature will look and function.
- **Attach designs to user stories:** Include these visual representations with the user story to provide context and clarity.

#### Step 6:  Review with the Development Team

- **Ensure feasibility:** Discuss user stories with developers to get feedback on technical feasibility and potential challenges.
- **Use a project management tool:** Maintain a backlog of user stories in a tool like Jira, Trello, or GitLab to track progress and facilitate collaboration.

#### Step 7:  Score and Prioritise User Stories

- **Estimate effort:** Use a pointing system (like the Fibonacci sequence) to estimate the effort required for each user story.
- **Prioritise based on value and effort:** Determine which user stories deliver the most value to users with the least amount of effort.

#### Step 8: Plan Sprints

- **Schedule user stories:** Group prioritised user stories into sprints, considering the team's capacity and the sprint duration.
- **Conduct sprint planning meetings:** Hold meetings with stakeholders to discuss and finalise the sprint backlog, ensuring alignment on goals and priorities.

#### Step 9:  Develop and Test

- **Develop the features:** The development team builds the features according to the user stories and acceptance criteria.
- **Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT):** Before releasing the feature, conduct UAT with real users or have the product owner test the functionality from the user's perspective. This helps identify any issues or areas for improvement.

#### Step 10:  Iterate and Improve

- **Gather feedback:** Continuously collect feedback from users after the feature is released.
- **Refine user stories:** Use feedback to refine existing user stories or create new ones to address evolving user needs.

### **Conclusion**

Creating user stories requires you to understand user needs and to take their perspective. This understanding usually comes from good user research. By creating user stories you can ensure that the rest of the team has a good understanding of those needs as well. Involving a cross-disciplinary team in the user story scoring and prioritisation will ensure the team is focusing on the most important aspects of the product. Ultimately, creating well thought out and researched user stories can help you create more successful products that truly meet the needs of its users.
