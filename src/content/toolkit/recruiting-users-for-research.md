## Overview

> Finding participants for user research is rarely easy, but it's one of the most important steps. The quality of your research depends on recruiting the right people who represent your actual users.

## The Challenge

**Why recruitment is difficult:**

* **Busy professionals** - Your target users are often time-poor
* **Limited budget** - Incentives and recruitment services cost money
* **Niche audiences** - Specialized users (e.g., environmental data scientists) are hard to find
* **Cold outreach** - Low response rates to initial contact attempts
* **Scheduling conflicts** - Coordinating availability across multiple participants

**But it's worth the effort.** Even 5-6 quality participants can reveal critical insights that save months of development time.

## Recruitment Methods

### LinkedIn Outreach (What We Used)

**How it works:**
* Search for professionals matching your target user profile
* Review profiles to ensure they fit your criteria
* Send personalized connection requests with context
* Follow up with research invitation once connected

**Pros:**
* Direct access to professionals in specific roles
* Can verify experience through profiles
* Free to use
* Works well for B2B and professional audiences

**Cons:**
* Time-intensive (manual search and outreach)
* Lower response rates (5-15% typical)
* Requires clear, compelling messaging
* May feel intrusive if not done thoughtfully

**Tips:**
* Personalize every message - reference their work
* Be transparent about time commitment (10-15 minutes)
* Explain the value - how their input helps
* Keep initial message short

### Other Practical Methods

#### Existing Networks
* **Your organisation's contacts** - Customers, partners, collaborators
* **Email lists** - If you have an existing mailing list
* **Team connections** - Ask colleagues for introductions

**Best for:** Quick recruitment, trusted participants

#### Social Media & Forums
* **Twitter/X** - Post requests in relevant communities
* **Reddit** - Subreddits related to your domain
* **Slack/Discord communities** - Domain-specific professional groups
* **Academic networks** - ResearchGate, university mailing lists

**Best for:** Reaching enthusiasts and engaged communities

#### Events & Conferences
* **Conference attendees** - Recruit at relevant events
* **Workshop participants** - Invite engagement during/after sessions
* **Webinar audiences** - Follow up with attendees

**Best for:** Face-to-face rapport, motivated participants

#### Recruitment Services (When Budget Allows)
* **UserTesting.com** - General consumer audiences
* **Respondent.io** - B2B and specialized professionals
* **User Interviews** - Flexible participant pools

**Best for:** Speed, diverse audiences, when budget is available

## Screening Process

**Always screen participants before research:**

1. **Define your criteria** - What makes someone a good participant?
2. **Create brief screener** - 3-5 questions maximum
3. **Focus on behavior** - What they do, not what they think
4. **Mix demographics** - Diverse perspectives matter

**Example screening questions:**
* Do you regularly work with environmental data? (Yes/No)
* How often do you combine data from multiple sources?
* What sector do you work in?

## Incentives & Compensation

**People's time has value. Consider offering:**

* **Gift cards** - Amazon, coffee shops
* **Early access** - To your product or findings
* **Recognition** - Credit in reports, co-authorship opportunities
* **Reciprocal value** - Share insights that help their work

**Check your organisation's policies** on participant compensation.

## Customer Sprint Approach

For rapid recruitment (5-6 users in 1-2 weeks), consider the [Customer Sprint methodology](/co-creation-toolkit/toolkit/prototyping/):

* **Day 1-2:** Identify target user groups
* **Day 2-3:** Outreach and screening
* **Day 4-5:** Conduct research sessions

This compressed timeline creates urgency and momentum.

## Realistic Expectations

**Be prepared for:**
* **10-20% response rate** on cold outreach
* **50% no-show rate** if you don't confirm beforehand
* **2-3 weeks minimum** for quality recruitment
* **Multiple recruitment channels** working in parallel

**Success factors:**
* Clear value proposition for participants
* Minimal time commitment (10-30 minutes ideal)
* Flexible scheduling options
* Follow-up and reminders
