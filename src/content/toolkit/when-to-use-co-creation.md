## Overview

> Co-creation works best when applied strategically at key moments in your project lifecycle. Understanding **when** to engage users is just as important as understanding **how** to engage them.

## When Co-Creation Delivers Maximum Value

### At Project Inception

**Understanding user needs from the start prevents costly mistakes later.**

* **Identify real problems** before committing to solutions
* **Validate assumptions** about user requirements and pain points
* **Build stakeholder buy-in** by involving them from day one
* **Define success criteria** that matter to actual users

**Key benefit**: Ensures you're building the right thing, not just building things right.

### During Development Cycles

**Regular testing keeps you on track and prevents drift.**

* **Test prototypes early and often** to catch issues when they're cheap to fix
* **Validate design decisions** with real user feedback
* **Iterate based on evidence**, not assumptions
* **Maintain alignment** between development and user needs

**Key benefit**: Reduces waste by catching misalignments before they become expensive problems.

### At Key Decision Points

**Involve users when making critical choices about direction.**

* **Feature prioritisation** - what to build next
* **Design alternatives** - which user experience approach to take
* **Trade-off decisions** - what features to optimise for
* **Pivot or persevere** - major strategic choices about future direction

**Key benefit**: Makes better decisions by incorporating diverse perspectives.

## When NOT to Use Co-Creation

Not every task requires user involvement. Skip co-creation for:

* **Pure technical implementation details** users won't interact with
* **Legal or security requirements** with no flexibility
* **Routine maintenance** that doesn't change user experience
* **Decisions already validated** through previous research

## Balancing User Needs with Technical Constraints

Co-creation often reveals ideal user requirements, but practical constraints like technology choices, available skills, and budgets may limit what's feasible. **Managing this gap transparently is crucial for maintaining trust and delivering value.**

When you choose a specific technical approach—such as a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool like Esri Experience Builder, or a reusable template—you often gain speed and reduce maintenance costs, but inherit constraints on functionality and user experience.

**The trap:** Heavy customisation to meet every user need can negate the benefits of using the RAD tool in the first place.

### The 80/20 Approach to User Needs

Sometimes the best outcome is delivering **80% of user needs for 20% of the cost** by accepting the constraints of a particular technical approach. This requires:

#### Early Transparency

* Share technical constraints during co-creation sessions
* Explain the trade-offs between custom builds vs. RAD tools
* Be upfront about what's achievable within the chosen approach

#### User Buy-In

* Present the value proposition: faster delivery, lower maintenance
* Involve users in prioritising which 80% of needs to focus on
* Show how the approach enables future iterations

#### Smart Prioritisation

* Use co-creation to identify which features deliver most value
* Focus on the critical user journeys that must work well
* Accept "good enough" on lower-priority features

#### Managing Expectations

* Set clear expectations about UX limitations from the platform
* Frame it as phase 1, with potential for enhancement later
* Celebrate the faster time-to-value

### Key Questions to Ask

* **Have we explained the technical approach and its constraints clearly?**
* **Do users understand the trade-off between speed/cost and customization?**
* **Have we prioritized features together, focusing on the highest-value 80%?**
* **Are we being realistic about when customization is worth the investment?**
* **Have we planned how to iterate based on real usage data?**

## Quick Decision Framework

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Will this decision significantly impact users?** → If yes, consider co-creation
2. **Are there multiple valid approaches?** → If yes, user input helps choose
3. **Could we be making wrong assumptions?** → If yes, validate with users
4. **Is there time to act on feedback?** → If no, don't create false expectations

## Actionable Advice

* **Start small**: Even a single focus group at project start beats no user input
* **Book time now**: Schedule testing sessions at the end of your sprint/cycle today
* **Make it routine**: Build co-creation checkpoints into your standard process
* **Close the loop**: Always share back what you learned and what changed

## Conclusion

Co-creation isn't a one-time event - it's most powerful when applied strategically throughout the project lifecycle. **Start early to understand needs. Test regularly to stay on track. Engage at decision points to make better choices.**

The investment in co-creation at these key moments pays dividends by building products that actually solve real problems for real users.
