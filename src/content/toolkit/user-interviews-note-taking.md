## Overview

> Use this [note taking template](/co-creation-toolkit/assets/toolkit/interviews/user-testing-interview-template.docx) to maximise the information you gather during user interviews and testing sessions.

### When to use interviews

* **Before you design**: Conduct interviews early to understand user needs and guide the design direction.
* **Throughout the design process**: Use interviews iteratively to test prototypes, gather feedback on revisions, and ensure your solution remains user-centered.

### How to conduct effective interviews

* **Set clear goals**: What specific user needs or aspects of your solution do you want to evaluate?
* **Craft open-ended questions**: Encourage users to elaborate on their experiences and avoid leading them towards specific answers.
* **Actively listen & observe**: Pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues to gain a holistic understanding of user perspectives.
* **Analyse & synthesize findings**: Identify patterns and key themes from the interviews to inform design decisions.
