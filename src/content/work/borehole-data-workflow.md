  Our team undertook a project to develop infographics illustrating the digital workflow for AGS (Association of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists) borehole data management. AGS data is the industry-standard exchange format for geotechnical data in the UK, and our dataset comprised 1.3 million records.

## Objective

The goal was to enhance clarity and communication in maintaining onshore borehole data through a visually intuitive representation of the digital workflow.

## Execution

We designed infographics that succinctly conveyed each step of the AGS borehole data management process. These visual aids provided a clear understanding of data flow, processing stages, and decision points within the workflow.
