Co-design was one of the main principles in this project. We wanted to ensure that users and wider team are involved in all the stages of product development. We created wireframes and prototypes to test our ideas and assumptions early, before turning them into code. The prototypes were tested with users and feedback was collected to ensure that the product was as user-friendly as possible. This ensured that developer time was used efficiently.

This approach also helped to build trust and confidence in the product. Project partners were invested in the design process and the team was able to build a strong working relationship with the client and a product that addresses important issues.
