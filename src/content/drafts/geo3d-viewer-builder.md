## Overview

> This case study outlines the Polish Geological Institute (PGI) and British Geological Survey's (BGS) initiative to build an improved web-based 3D model viewer, based on an existing solution developed by PGI. Our goal is to to make complex geological data more accessible and shareable.

### Background

Geological Surveys faces challenges in sharing complex 3D geological models with external stakeholders. Currently, many partner organisations who could benefit from 3D geological data lack the necessary software to view these models, hindering collaboration and data accessibility. The Polish Geological Survey has developed a web-based 3D viewer that addresses this issue, but currently it relies on an outdated and insecure Drupal CMS which presents security risks. We aim to enhance this viewer, making it more intuitive and easy to use both for people publishing models and those viewing them. This case study will document our approach, impact and lessons learned along the way.
