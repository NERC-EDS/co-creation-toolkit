## Overview

> This case study outlines the Polish Geological Institute (PGI) and British Geological Survey's (BGS) initiative to build an improved web-based 3D model viewer, based on an existing solution developed by PGI. Our goal is to to make complex geological data more accessible and shareable.

### Background

Geological Surveys faces challenges in sharing complex 3D geological models with external stakeholders. Currently, many partner organisations who could benefit from 3D geological data lack the necessary software to view these models, hindering collaboration and data accessibility. The Polish Geological Survey has developed a web-based 3D viewer that addresses this issue, but currently it relies on an outdated and insecure Drupal CMS which presents security risks. Furthermore, the back-end interface used for model scene assembly cannot be shared with anyone outside PGI. This creates an urgent need for an external web application that will allow users to create model scenes from their own data and publish them in Geo3D. In collaboration with the BGS, the PGI is developing the Geo3D Builder web application as a solution for that challenge.

The Geo3D Builder will be a user-friendly, web-based application that empowers users to create and publish 3D geospatial scenes using various types of geological model data and other contextual information. This new tool will be independent of the Drupal CMS and will provide a streamlined workflow with a clear, step-by-step wizard. The application will support a variety of data types and formats, giving users the flexibility to construct rich and informative scenes. It will provide a seamless user experience.

Alongside the development of the Geo3D Builder, PGI is actively working to modernize and enhance the Geo3D viewer itself, making it independent of Drupal and adding more features to improve user interaction and overall usability of the platform. For that purpose, the Geo3D Builder will provide valuable user feedback, helping PGI to improve all Geo3D related aspects. This case study is going to document all parts of the development and collaboration process, all technical and non technical challenges, and all lessons learned along the way.
