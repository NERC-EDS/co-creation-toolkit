## Overview

> The Land InSight project investigated the benefits of environmental digital twins for diverse users. This case study details the creation of user personas to clearly communicate the needs and goals of potential users to the project team.

### Methods and Tools Used

* **Personas**: Personas are fictional characters created to represent different user types for a product, service, or website. They are based on research and data about real users.
* **Desk Study**: Collection and analysis of existing information, such as reports, user research findings, and academic papers, to gain insights and understanding of user groups who could benefit from environmental digital twins.
