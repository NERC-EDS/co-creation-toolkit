## Overview

> Environmental data is scattered across multiple data centres, making it difficult for users to find and integrate what they need. We used customer sprint methodology to understand if an integrated platform could solve this problem—and what it should offer.

## The Challenge

**The problem**: UK Environmental data lives in silos across different data centres (e.g. NERC data centres BODC, CEDA, EIDC, NGDC, UK PDC) and while the Environmental Data Service (EDS) could break down these silos, if designed well and with end users involved, we first needed to track down those potential users. 

**The question**: How could a unified environmental data platform help and what should it provide?

## Research Approach: Customer Sprint

We adapted Google Ventures' customer sprint methodology to rapidly understand user needs:

### 1. Identify User Groups via Literature

Started with past user research, collating reports, papers, survey rersults and interview transcripts from past projects that involved users expressing their goals and painpoints with environemntal data or digital services. Through this mini systematic review, with a little help from Google NotebookLM, we identified the following as potentially key user types of the EDS:

* Environmental Data Analysts
* Climate Scientists
* Remote Sensing Specialists
* GIS Analysts
* Water Resources Scientists
* Sustainability Consultants
* Renewable Energy Analysts
* Environmental Policy Advisors

### 2. Real-World Analysis via LinkedIn

Armed with a high level understanding of our taget users we tried a range of methods to find real world people that matched our conceptual personas, prioritising  previously unknown contacts without obvious connections through our existing networks. 

* We searched public profiles on various platforms but found most success in the professional profiles on LinkedIn
* We collectively reviewed dozens of profiles, exploring named projects and publications
* Identified concrete examples of relevant data usage or needs
* Then we triaged the selection to focus on our 'bullseye customer', in this case users of environmental monitoring data who were technically capable of using services such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  

### 3. Contact and Screen Participants

Identified and contacted professionals on LinkedIn whose profiles matched our target user groups. Used a brief screening process to ensure participants worked regularly with environmental data, combined data from multiple sources, and represented diverse sectors (academia, government, consulting, energy).

### 4. Interview and Test our Design  Concepts

We designed an interview structure to get to know the particpants better, explore their understanding of the EDS and crucially gather their thoughts on our initial design concepts throughthe use of three simple landing page prototypes. 

**Why just prototype landing pages?** 
Google Ventures' customer sprint methodology suggests that artifacts like a landing page mockup can serve as a lean, effective tool to "fast-forward" into the future, enabling teams to see how customers react to a new product idea before any substantial engineering effort begins.

We used three landing page design options to reveal what users truly value by encouraging discussion of trade-offs rather than forcing binary choices and allowing us to capture different user needs.

Our three designs prioritised different features: 
* **Researcher Version**: APIs, Jupyter notebooks, comprehensive data
* **Decision-Maker Version**: Dashboards, visualisations, actionable insights
* **Integrator Version**: Flexible APIs, multiple formats, customisation

## What We Learned

### Three Key User Groups

**Academic Researchers** need APIs, analysis-ready datasets, and DOIs for citation, willing to reformat or process useful, well described, data 

**Applied Data Scientists** need unified search, cloud-optimised formats, and tool integration

**Remote Sensing Specialists** need integrated EO/ground data and cloud processing environments

## Actionable Insights

**What worked:**

* **Starting with literature** quickly identified real user roles
* **LinkedIn research** revealed concrete, real-world use cases
* **Multiple prototypes** stimulated richer discussion than single concepts
* **Screening survey** efficiently qualified participants

**Key lessons:**

* Users span a wide technical spectrum—one size won't fit all
* Data discovery is a bigger problem than we initially thought
* "Analysis-ready" means different things to different users
* Citation and reproducibility matter to academics
* Integration with existing tools is crucial

**Next steps:**

* Refine the process based on feedback and considering how environmental research differs from commercial product design
* Use findings to inform platform development decisions
