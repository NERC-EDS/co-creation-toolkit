## Overview

> Environmental data is scattered across multiple data centres, making it difficult for users to find and integrate what they need. We used customer sprint methodology to understand if an integrated platform could solve this problem—and what it should offer.

## The Challenge

**The problem**: Environmental data lives in silos across different data centres (BODC, CEDA, EIDC, NGDC, UK PDC). Users struggle to:

* Discover what data is available
* Access data from multiple sources
* Integrate datasets from different domains
* Know which data centre holds what they need

**The question**: Would a unified platform help? What should it provide?

## Research Approach: Customer Sprint

We adapted Google Ventures' customer sprint methodology to rapidly understand user needs:

### 1. Identify User Groups via Literature

Started with "Environmental Data Science: A Pythonic Approach" to identify key roles:

* Environmental Data Analysts
* Climate Scientists
* Remote Sensing Specialists
* GIS Analysts
* Water Resources Scientists
* Sustainability Consultants
* Renewable Energy Analysts
* Environmental Policy Advisors

### 2. Real-World Analysis via LinkedIn

* Searched for professionals matching identified roles
* Reviewed their profiles, projects, and publications
* Identified concrete examples of data usage
* Documented real-world use cases

### 3. Contact and Screen Participants

Identified and contacted professionals on LinkedIn whose profiles matched our target user groups. Used a brief screening process to ensure participants worked regularly with environmental data, combined data from multiple sources, and represented diverse sectors (academia, government, consulting, energy).

### 4. Test Three Platform Concepts

Created three simple landing page prototypes targeting different user needs:

* **Researcher Version**: APIs, Jupyter notebooks, comprehensive data
* **Decision-Maker Version**: Dashboards, visualisations, actionable insights
* **Integrator Version**: Flexible APIs, multiple formats, customisation

**Why three prototypes?** Three options reveal what users truly value by encouraging discussion of trade-offs rather than forcing binary choices.

## What We Learned

### Three Key User Groups

**Academic Researchers** need APIs, analysis-ready datasets, and DOIs for citation

**Applied Data Scientists** need unified search, cloud-optimised formats, and tool integration

**Remote Sensing Specialists** need integrated EO/ground data and cloud processing environments

## Actionable Insights

**What worked:**

* **Starting with literature** quickly identified real user roles
* **LinkedIn research** revealed concrete, real-world use cases
* **Multiple prototypes** stimulated richer discussion than single concepts
* **Screening survey** efficiently qualified participants

**Key lessons:**

* Users span a wide technical spectrum—one size won't fit all
* Data discovery is a bigger problem than we initially thought
* "Analysis-ready" means different things to different users
* Citation and reproducibility matter to academics
* Integration with existing tools is crucial

**Next steps:**

* Refine based on feedback
* Distribute to wider environmental data community
* Use findings to inform platform development decisions
