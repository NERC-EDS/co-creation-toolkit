## Overview

Our objective was to co-design an information and data sharing platform that makes it easy to find and access all the latest data and information related to technology metals in one place.

We achieved this by setting up a collaborative design approach that allowed a cross-functional team to take ownership of this platform and to work together collaboratively and effectively.

## Approach

To create team alignment and agree on a shared vision we conducted a design sprint that ran over the course of three days. On the first day, the team reviewed background information, heard expert talks, and identified opportunities and grouped them into themes. We also agreed on a long-term goal and three questions that would guide the sprint. On the second day, the group did concept sketching exercises and presented inspirational websites and tools. On the third day, we reviewed detailed concepts from the previous day and created a storyboard that served as the starting point for a more detailed prototype. After the workshop, we also did a card sorting exercise to clarify the information architecture and created an interactive prototype for evaluating the effectiveness and usability of this new platform.

### What is a design sprint? 

An ideal design sprint is a process that allows a team to solve complex problems and test ideas in a short period of time, usually five days. The outcome of an ideal design sprint should be a clear understanding of the problem the team is trying to solve, a set of feasible solutions to that problem, and a clear plan for how to build and test a prototype of the best solution.

## Impact

One of the key challenges of this project was to effectively aggregate and integrate knowledge, data, and information from various sources and stakeholders. To address this, we employed the use of Google Sites as a prototyping and collaboration platform. This enabled multiple team members to work simultaneously on the website, while also facilitating the review and approval process prior to publishing.

This approach greatly enhanced our team’s productivity and efficiency. The end result was a fully operational, highly detailed prototype of a technology metals website, which established the fundamental information architecture and already included information on key products, components, and materials.

## Lessons learned

Collaboration among cross-functional teams can be a challenge, but when executed effectively, it can yield results that surpass the sum of individual contributions. The diversity of perspectives and expertise on technology metals allowed us to develop a platform that enables users to examine technology metals from a variety of angles, including the material, component, and product level.

This experience also highlighted the value of an iterative design approach. The final version of the website was significantly different from the initial prototype, which is why it was beneficial to commence with low-fidelity prototypes and to incrementally increase their complexity as we gained greater understanding of user needs and behaviors.

We used stock images and illustrations to illustrate some concepts on the website, but they didn’t have a matching style. Towards the end of the project we had to revisit these assets and replace some of them in order to create a more consistent and professional looking platform. To make this task easier, it is important to define the style of images and illustrations at the start of a project and to make sure everyone knows where to source them from.
